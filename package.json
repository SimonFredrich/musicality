The idea is to make a cms and frontend combination capable of displaying interactive javascript gadgets related to music concepts, like a drag and drop piece of sheet music to fit figures to rythms, and/or notes. On later versions it could include a login system with comments, or a cms login system to include more people willing to write for the page.",
